# THEME - WOMEN SECURITY
In our Country, even though it has super power and an
economic development, there are still many crimes against
women.The primary issue in the handling of these cases by
the police lies in constraints preventing them from
responding quickly to calls of distress. These constraints
include not knowing the location of the crime, and not
knowing the crime is occurring at all: at the victim's end,
reaching the police assuredly and discreetly is a
challenge.The atrocities against the women can be brought
to an end with the help of our product "Snap Sandal". This
device is an IOT based security system, designed for women .
So, now whenever a girl or a woman is in danger or feels
unsafe she can just turn on the camera by pressing the
button and then the further work is done by the GPS and the
GSM.The GPS tracks the location and sends the message to
GSM, which in turn sends the message to Arduino which
finally sends the coordinates of the location of the sandal to
the receiver.
